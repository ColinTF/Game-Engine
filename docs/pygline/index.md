Module pygline
==============
Welcome to pygline:

pygline is the current working and tempory name for a project by Colin Finnie.
It purpose is to create a system for rapidly prototyping games or just creating simple games.

My current plan is to use the game engine to develop learning enviornments for AI like the open-ai gym.

For now this project mostly functions as a way to learn opengl and improve my python skills.

Thanks for checking it out!
